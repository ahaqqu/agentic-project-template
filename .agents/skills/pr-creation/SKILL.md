# PR Creation

Use this skill when creating a pull request.

## Before creating the PR

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Run the project CI gate locally: `bun run check && bun run test && bun run size-limit`. Fix failures until green.
3. Read `AGENTS.md`. Validate code against the Definition of Done.
4. Do not read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
5. If this PR addresses one or more GitHub issues, gather their numbers/URLs from the current branch context. You will need them for the PR description.

## Validation

Follow the Definition of Done in `AGENTS.md`:

- All CI gates green.
- Contracts written before implementation.
- API or UI changes: BDD tests added.
- Schema changes: server migration (raw SQL in `apps/api/migrations/`) + client migration (in `packages/local-first`) + `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump.
- New routes: Valibot contract in `packages/contracts` (`@app/contracts`) + `hono-openapi` route definition; `/openapi.json` regenerates from the same definitions.
- No new paid dependency in the critical path.
- Nothing sensitive in the diff.
- Architectural changes documented in PR description.
- Human-review gate stated if triggered: destructive migration, new dependency, auth change.

## PR description

```markdown
## Summary
Concise summary of changes, not a file list.

## Closes
Closes #123, #124. When the PR is merged, GitHub auto-closes these issues.
- Use the keyword `Closes` (or `Fixes` / `Resolves`) followed by the issue number, e.g. `Closes #123`.
- List every issue this PR fully resolves. Do not list issues that are only partially addressed — those need a comment, not auto-close.
- If this PR does not address a tracked issue, write `None`.

## Architecture
Architectural changes, or `None`.

## Backend
Backend changes with test proof, or `None`.

## Frontend
Frontend changes with test proof, or `None`.

## Security Review
Security implications, or `None`.

## Performance Review
Performance implications, or `None`.

## Acceptance Criteria
Checklist from AGENTS.md Definition of Done.

## Documentation
Docs updated: `AGENTS.md` / `adr/`, or `None`.

## Limitations & Warnings
Any limitations, or `None`.
```

## Rules

- You MUST NEVER merge your own PR. Submit for human review only.
- You MUST NOT create a PR with a dirty working tree.
- You MUST create a PR even for trivial changes.
- You MUST NEVER add a co-author to the PR description or commit messages.
- You MUST reference relevant GitHub issues in the PR description so they close automatically upon merge.
