# Guided Implementation

Use this skill when implementing a plan that is unclear, complex, or may affect architecture.

## Before writing code

1. Read the plan.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` for universal guardrails.
3. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §1–14 to verify alignment.
4. Review the domain checklist below for the areas your plan touches.
5. List implementation steps: contracts → tests → implementation → validation.
6. Highlight deviations. Do not start until the user confirms.

## Domain checklist

For each area the plan touches, verify compliance before writing code.

### Routes

- [ ] Zod schema defined in `packages/shared-zod` before route implementation.
- [ ] Route uses `@hono/zod-openapi` on shared schemas.
- [ ] Route path under `/v1/`.
- [ ] OpenAPI spec regenerated after route addition. Docs at `/docs` must not drift.

### Database schema

- [ ] Drizzle migration written in `packages/db-schema/migrations/`.
- [ ] Client migration written in `apps/web/src/lib/migrations/`.
- [ ] `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped in `packages/sync-protocol`.
- [ ] SQL uses only standard features — no SQLite-specific or D1-specific extensions.

### Sync logic

- [ ] Writes are optimistic into Tinybase MergeableStore CRDT. No hand-rolled last-write-wins.
- [ ] Changes persist to IndexedDB in the same tick.
- [ ] Batched via `POST /v1/sync`. No polling loops.
- [ ] Retries use exponential backoff; permanent errors stop.
- [ ] Requests include `schemaVersion` and `clientVersion`.
- [ ] Merge logic is idempotent, commutative, and propagates deletes.
- [ ] Multi-tab: single leader elected. Peers receive state via BroadcastChannel.
- [ ] Property tests added for idempotency, commutativity, and delete propagation. See `.agents/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md`.

### Components

- [ ] Uses shadcn/ui primitives or follows the same custom pattern.
- [ ] All user-facing strings wrapped with i18n.
- [ ] Dates, numbers, and currency formatted via the `Intl` API.
- [ ] Tailwind CSS only. No runtime CSS-in-JS.

### Adapters

- [ ] Interface defined in `packages/infra/` first, before implementation.
- [ ] Adapter injected via env vars. Business logic never imports Cloudflare-specific types.
- [ ] Business logic accesses adapters through the interface — never through `env.*` directly.

### Payments

- [ ] Uses the Payments adapter interface. Provider APIs never called directly.
- [ ] Webhook handlers verify signatures before JSON parsing (raw-body verification).
- [ ] Webhook handlers are idempotent (same payload twice = same state as once).
- [ ] Premium features gated by ConfigStore entitlement checks at the edge, not client-side.

### Security

- [ ] Zod validates every external input boundary.
- [ ] Secrets injected via `wrangler secret` — never committed.
- [ ] `secure-headers` middleware applied; CORS locked to known origins.

### Testing

- [ ] Unit tests (Vitest) for all business logic, schemas, store queries.
- [ ] Property tests (fast-check) for sync merge, client migrations, webhook idempotency.
- [ ] BDD tests (Playwright-BDD) for user-facing flows, offline-to-online sync.
- [ ] Coverage above 80%. See `.agents/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md` for patterns.

## During implementation

- Write contracts (Zod schemas, types) before implementation.
- Write tests before or alongside implementation.
- When deviating from the plan, pause and ask for approval.
- When touching architecture, pause and ask for approval.

## After implementation

- Run the project CI gate locally: `vp check && vp test && vp size-limit`. `vp` is the Vite+ task runner; run `vp help` if the command format differs. If no `vp` binary is available, see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §14 for tooling to scaffold.
- Verify against `AGENTS.md` Definition of Done.
- Report what was implemented and what changed from the plan.
