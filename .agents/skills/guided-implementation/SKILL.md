# Guided Implementation

Use this skill when implementing a plan that is unclear, complex, or may affect architecture.

## Before writing code

1. Read the plan.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` for universal guardrails.
3. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` fully (including §14 Tooling) to verify alignment.
4. Review the domain checklist below for the areas your plan touches.
5. List implementation steps: contracts → tests → implementation → validation.
6. Highlight deviations. Do not start until the user confirms.

## Domain checklist

For each area the plan touches, verify compliance before writing code.

### Routes

- [ ] Valibot schema defined in `packages/contracts` (`@app/contracts`) before route implementation.
- [ ] Route uses `hono-openapi` on shared schemas.
- [ ] Route path under `/v1/`.
- [ ] OpenAPI spec regenerated from route definitions. Docs at `/docs` must not drift.

### Database schema

- [ ] Raw SQL migration written in `apps/api/migrations/`.
- [ ] Client migration written in `packages/local-first` (or `apps/web/src/lib/` if not yet moved).
- [ ] `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped in `packages/local-first`.
- [ ] SQL uses only standard features — no SQLite-specific or D1-specific extensions.

### Sync logic

- [ ] Writes are optimistic into the custom LWW-element-set CRDT in `packages/local-first`. Tinybase is not used.
- [ ] Changes persist to IndexedDB in the same tick.
- [ ] Batched via `POST /v1/sync`. No polling loops.
- [ ] Retries use exponential backoff; permanent errors stop.
- [ ] Requests include `schemaVersion` and `clientVersion`.
- [ ] Merge logic is idempotent, commutative (including exact-timestamp ties), and propagates deletes.
- [ ] Multi-tab: single leader elected. Peers receive state via BroadcastChannel.
- [ ] Property tests added for idempotency, commutativity, associativity, delete-wins, and GC safety. See `.agents/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md`.

### Components

- [ ] Uses shadcn/ui primitives or follows the same custom pattern.
- [ ] All user-facing strings wrapped with i18n.
- [ ] Dates, numbers, and currency formatted via the `Intl` API.
- [ ] Tailwind CSS only. No runtime CSS-in-JS.

### Adapters

- [ ] Interface defined in `packages/infra/` first, before implementation.
- [ ] Adapter injected via env vars. Business logic never imports Cloudflare-specific types.
- [ ] Business logic accesses adapters through the interface — never through `env.*` directly.

### Payments

- [ ] Uses the Payments adapter interface. Provider APIs never called directly.
- [ ] Webhook handlers verify signatures before JSON parsing (raw-body verification).
- [ ] Webhook handlers are idempotent (same payload twice = same state as once).
- [ ] Premium features gated by ConfigStore entitlement checks at the edge, not client-side.

### Security

- [ ] Valibot validates every external input boundary.
- [ ] Secrets injected via `wrangler secret` — never committed.
- [ ] `secure-headers` middleware applied; CORS locked to known origins.

### Testing

- [ ] Unit tests (Vitest) for all business logic, schemas, store queries.
- [ ] Property tests (fast-check) for sync merge, client migrations, webhook idempotency.
- [ ] BDD tests (Playwright-BDD) for user-facing flows, offline-to-online sync.
- [ ] Coverage above 80%. See `.agents/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md` for patterns.

## During implementation

- Write contracts (Valibot schemas, types) before implementation.
- Write tests before or alongside implementation.
- When deviating from the plan, pause and ask for approval.
- When touching architecture, pause and ask for approval.
- Checkpoint commit at every test-green point (see below) — never batch all commits to the end.

## Phase boundaries

A run is billed per request at its current context size, so the last quartile of
requests costs multiples of the first; and a run killed by a rate limit loses
everything not yet committed. Real evidence: a senior-implementer run in this
repo (issue #95, session `sess_subagent_agent_da680873-b5fb-492a-af08-76a277d27c1e`,
2026-08-30) billed 38M input tokens over 320 requests with per-request average
growing 41k → 95k → 140k → 199k across quartiles, while its five checkpoint
commits (bffc985, 13fe0ac, c5e2bd7, f028a28, faf033d) preserved the full
effort, which landed on `main` via the squash-merge in #106 (`36610c3`). The run
is therefore a sequence of explicit phases — **implement → handoff →
test loop → report** — and each boundary below is mandatory, not advisory:

1. **Implement phase.** One-pass reads; do not re-read files you already hold,
   and trim command output as you go. Checkpoint commit as soon as any gate
   passes locally (typecheck, lint, a single test file), not only the full
   suite.
2. **Handoff boundary — before the test-iteration phase.** The exploration and
   writing you did to produce the change is dead weight for iterating on test
   failures. Before the first full test iteration, hand the verification loop
   (run gates, read failures, patch, rerun) to a fresh scoped context that
   carries only the failing output and the code under test; compaction, where
   the harness provides it, is an equivalent fallback.
3. **Test loop.** Iterate to green in the lean context. Commit at every
   test-green point so a kill loses nothing but the current request.
4. **Report/review boundary — after review, before addressing feedback.**
   Address review findings in a fresh context (a new scoped subagent;
   compaction, where the harness provides it, is equivalent) that carries the
   findings and the relevant diff — not the whole implementation transcript.
   The project-owned implementer-class role profiles (e.g.
   `.zcode/agents/implementer.md`, `.zcode/agents/senior-implementer.md`)
   encode the same boundaries.

## After implementation

- Run the project CI gate locally: `bun run check && bun run test && bun run size-limit`. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §14 for tooling.
- Verify against `AGENTS.md` Definition of Done.
- Report what was implemented and what changed from the plan.
- **Handoff:** load `writing-tests` to add any missing unit, property, and BDD coverage. After tests pass with >80% coverage, load `pr-creation` to create the pull request.
