Perform a deep code quality audit of the current branch's changes. Rethink how the changes are structured to meaningfully improve code quality without changing behavior. Be ambitious: search for "code judo" moves that make whole branches, helpers, modes, conditionals, or layers disappear. Measure twice, cut once.

## Non-negotiable standards

0. **Be ambitious about structural simplification.** Prefer the solution that makes the code feel inevitable in hindsight. Delete complexity rather than rearrange it.
1. **Do not let a PR push a file from under 1k lines to over 1k lines without a very strong reason.** Extract helpers/subcomponents/modules instead of letting a file sprawl.
2. **Do not allow random spaghetti growth.** Ad-hoc conditionals, scattered special cases, or one-off branches inserted into unrelated flows are design problems, not nitpicks. Push logic into a dedicated abstraction, helper, state machine, or module.
3. **Bias toward cleaning the design, not just accepting working code.** If behavior can stay the same while structure becomes meaningfully cleaner, push for it.
4. **Prefer direct, boring, maintainable code over hacky or magical code.** Flag thin abstractions, identity wrappers, or pass-through helpers that add indirection without clarity.
5. **Push hard on type and boundary cleanliness.** Question unnecessary optionality, `unknown`, `any`, or cast-heavy code when a clearer type boundary could exist. Do not let silent fallbacks paper over unclear invariants.
6. **Keep logic in the canonical layer and reuse existing helpers.** Call out feature logic leaking into shared paths or implementation details leaking through APIs.
7. **Treat unnecessary sequential orchestration and non-atomic updates as design smells when the cleaner structure is obvious.**

## What to flag aggressively

- A complicated implementation where a cleaner reframing could delete whole categories of complexity.
- Refactors that move code around but fail to reduce concepts a reader must hold.
- One-off booleans/nullable modes/flags complicating existing control flow.
- Feature-specific logic leaking into general-purpose modules.
- Generic "magic" handling hiding simple structure.
- Copy-pasted logic instead of extracted helpers.
- Narrow edge-case handling in the middle of an already-busy function.
- Refactors that pass tests but make the code less modular or less readable.
- "Temporary" branching likely to become permanent debt.
- Bespoke helpers where the codebase already has a canonical utility for the job.
- Logic added in the wrong layer/package when there's a clear canonical home.
- Sequential async flow where independent work could be simpler in parallel.
- Partial-update logic leaving state less atomic than necessary.

## Review tone

Be direct, serious, and demanding about quality. Not rude — but don't soften major maintainability issues into mild suggestions. If the implementation missed an opportunity for dramatic simplification, say so clearly.

## Output expectations

Prioritize in this order:

1. Structural code-quality regressions
2. Missed opportunities for dramatic simplification
3. Spaghetti / branching complexity increases
4. Boundary / abstraction / type-contract problems
5. File-size and decomposition concerns
6. Modularity and abstraction issues
7. Legibility and maintainability concerns

## Approval bar

Do not approve merely because behavior seems correct. Presumptive blockers (unless the author justifies clearly):

- The PR preserves a lot of incidental complexity when a plausible code-judo move would delete it.
- The PR pushes a file from below 1000 lines to above 1000 lines.
- The PR adds ad-hoc branching that makes an existing flow more tangled.
- The PR solves a local problem by scattering feature checks across shared code.
- The PR adds an unnecessary abstraction, wrapper, or cast-heavy contract making the design more indirect.
- The PR duplicates an existing helper or puts logic in the wrong layer.

## Final response

For each finding:

- `ID` (assign sequentially: B1, B2, …)
- Priority
- `file:line` or file + region
- Evidence
- Recommended fix (a cleaner structure, not just a rephrase)

If you have NO medium-or-higher findings, say so explicitly. Prefer a smaller number of high-conviction comments over a long list of cosmetic notes.
