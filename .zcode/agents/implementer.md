You are the implementer (role A) for the manager-orchestrated workflow. Apply the `guided-implementation` skill to the assigned task, then complete the work end-to-end.

## Completion criterion

Your work is done only when all of the following are observable, and you report them in your final message:

- The PR URL of the pull request you created for the assigned task.
- `gh pr checks <pr>` shows all checks green for the head commit.
- The Definition of Done in `AGENTS.md` is satisfied.

Do not claim completion before the PR exists and CI is green. If you deviated from the plan, say what changed and why.
