# Role agents (ZCode adapter layer)

These files are the ZCode adapter layer for the manager-orchestrated workflow
in `.agents/skills/manager/SKILL.md`. Each role the manager dispatches
(`implementer`, `reviewer`, `assistant-manager`) is a defined subagent whose
body carries its operating persona and completion criterion. The `reviewer`
is itself a coordinator: it applies the `code-review` skill (the single
review entry point — thermos depth mandatory for code-touching PRs) and
internally dispatches two sub-reviewers
(`thermo-nuclear-review-subagent` for security/correctness,
`thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review-subagent` for code quality), posting
findings via the `thermos-with-comments` skill.

These files are the **only** harness-specific part of the workflow. The skills
in `.agents/skills/` are intentionally harness-agnostic so forks can run the
same pipeline in other agent harnesses (including DeepSeek-family CLIs) by
supplying their own role-agent definitions.

## Model selection

Every role ships **pinned by default**: each agent file carries a
`model: <providerId>/<modelName>` field, so the workflow runs on the same
models everywhere unless you override it.

Resolution order (used by ZCode):

1. **User override:** `~/.zcode/agents/<role>.md` (wins — best place for
   personal model choices that shouldn't be committed to the repo).
2. **Project pin:** `<repo>/.zcode/agents/<role>.md` (edit the files in
   this directory to change a per-project choice).
3. **Template default:** the pinned `model:` in these files (table below).

The two sub-reviewer agents are children of `reviewer`. They are pinned
separately by default; delete a sub-reviewer's `model:` field to make it
inherit the coordinator's model instead.

Recognized `model:` values:

- `inherit` — explicitly inherit the session default (equivalent to omitting
  the field).
- `lite` — the harness's configured lite model (cheaper tier).
- `<providerId>/<modelName>` — a concrete provider/model ref, e.g.
  `ollama/glm-5.3:cloud`.
- A bare `<modelName>` resolved against the session's default provider.

### Thought level

Agent files may also pin a `thoughtLevel:` frontmatter field (valid values:
`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` — the harness validates against this
set). Pin it explicitly whenever a role's model offers reasoning variants,
because a provider's `defaultVariant` is not a safe default: GLM-5.3's
provider config ships `defaultVariant: "max"`, and an unpinned dispatch
resolved to `max` for an entire implementation run (see issue #94). All
dispatched roles pin `thoughtLevel: high`.

**Why `high` for the implementer-class roles specifically:** ticket routing
labels hard tickets `model:high`, which dispatches them to the
senior-implementer. Its intended reasoning mode is `high`, so the pin matches
the routing label — a dispatch can never fall through to the channel's
`defaultVariant` (`max` for GLM-5.3). The observed #6 run is the counterexample
the pin prevents: senior-implementer resolved to `max` for all 280 requests
(issues #94/#96).

The pin is machine-checked: `bun run zcode:preflight` fails when any role file
in this directory omits `thoughtLevel:`, pins a value outside the validated
set, or — for the six dispatched roles above — pins anything other than
`high`, so the "all dispatched roles pin `thoughtLevel: high`" claim above is
blocking, not prose. Forks inherit this gate (it lives in template-owned
`scripts/`) but own this directory: a fork-added role file must carry a
`thoughtLevel:` pin (any validated value; the dispatched role names must pin
`high`) or the preflight fails. (The gate checks the config the client loads,
not the running client — after a real dispatch, recorded evidence of the
resolved variant is the telemetry DB's variant column, per issue #96.)

An invalid or unreachable `model:` falls back to the session default; it does
not hard-fail. Check agent discoverability in ZCode via
**Settings → Subagents**.

### Pinned defaults per role

| Role | Agent file | Pinned model | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| manager | (the session's own model — the manager is the session agent) | session model | orchestrates, never implements |
| implementer (default) | `implementer.md` | `ollama/glm-5.3-flash:cloud` | fast tier — does most of the regular-complexity work |
| senior-implementer (hard/`model:high`) | `senior-implementer.md` | `ollama/glm-5.3:cloud` | stronger tier — tickets where failure is silent (validators, trap questions, sample audits); do not downgrade |
| reviewer (coordinator) | `reviewer.md` | `ollama/kimi-k2.7-code:cloud` | coordinates the review and posts findings |
| thermo-nuclear-review-subagent | `thermo-nuclear-review-subagent.md` | `ollama/glm-5.3:cloud` | security/correctness pass |
| thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review-subagent | `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review-subagent.md` | `ollama/kimi-k2.7-code:cloud` | maintainability pass |
| assistant-manager | `assistant-manager.md` | `ollama/kimi-k2.7-code:cloud` | read-only fact-finding and adjudication evidence |
| test-implementer (`model:high` test phase) | `test-implementer.md` | `ollama/glm-5.3-flash:cloud` | writes the suite from the senior's test brief; never touches production source, never opens a PR |

## Phase-boundary discipline

The implementer-class roles (`implementer`, `senior-implementer`) carry an
operating discipline in their agent files, mirrored in the
`guided-implementation` skill (`.agents/skills/guided-implementation/SKILL.md`,
"Phase boundaries"): run **implement → handoff → test loop → report**
as explicit phases. Follow all three boundaries:

1. Checkpoint commit at every test-green point.
2. Hand the verification loop to a fresh scoped context (compaction, where the
   harness provides it, is equivalent) *before* entering test iteration.
3. Address review findings in a fresh context *after* review, never in the
   implementation context.

Ownership note: the skill path is template-owned (`.agents/` is an
`overwrite` entry in `template-sync.json`), so forks inherit the discipline;
`.zcode/agents/` is unlisted in that map (project-owned), so this directory
is where a fork customizes or extends it.

## Iteration guardrail and stuck reports

Implementer-class roles run under the mechanical iteration guardrail (issue
#98): a workspace hook (`scripts/iteration-guardrail/`, wired in
`.zcode/config.json`) counts failed verification cycles per session and
**denies** verification reruns past progress-based caps — 3 failed cycles on
the same failure, 8 failed cycles since the last successful verification
(both configurable in `scripts/iteration-guardrail/config.json`). The hook
fails open on its own internal errors and never blocks non-verification
commands, so a checkpoint commit is always available. The manager's
decision table for acting on a stuck report lives in the manager skill
(`.agents/skills/manager/SKILL.md`, Reliability & supervision).

### Stuck-report format (canonical)

When the guardrail denies a verification rerun — or whenever an agent judges
the loop stuck before the mechanical cap fires — it stops looping and reports
a **stuck-report** to the manager, containing exactly:

1. **Invariant under test** — the property the work must protect, stated so the receiver can verify it.
2. **Exact current failure** — the verification command and the precise error output.
3. **Attempted fixes** — every fix attempt, each with its outcome.
4. **Ruled-out hypotheses** — what was already eliminated and how.
5. **Checkpoint commit ref** — the work is committed to the branch **first**; escalation must never lose work.

The receiver must be able to act on this without re-deriving the history.
**Never fake done:** the completion criterion is unchanged by the guardrail —
a PR must exist and all its checks must be green. A cap, a deny, or a
stuck-report never substitutes for that evidence; escalate instead.

### Context budgets (defaults)

Each phase above runs under a hard budget: **~150k billed input tokens or
~150 requests, whichever is hit first**. These are the registry defaults for
the implementer-class roles; a role profile (`.zcode/agents/<role>.md`) or
an individual dispatch may override them tighter. When a phase passes its
budget, the subagent does not keep expanding context — it makes a checkpoint
commit, pushes the branch, and hands off: to a fresh scoped context carrying
the last checkpoint, or back to the manager through its normal report
channel. A budget handoff is compliance, not failure; silently continuing
past the budget is the anti-pattern. The manager restates this clause in
every implementer-class dispatch prompt (`.agents/skills/manager/SKILL.md`,
§1 Dispatch).

### Watchdog backstop thresholds (defaults)

The manager's efficiency watchdog (`.agents/skills/manager/SKILL.md`,
Reliability & supervision → Efficiency watchdog) independently watches every
dispatched role subagent from telemetry and acts on a breach. These registry
defaults are the canonical values; a role profile (`.zcode/agents/<role>.md`)
or an individual dispatch may override them tighter, never looser:

| Per-dispatch budget | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Billed input tokens (`input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens`) | ~5M |
| Requests (`model_usage` rows) | ~600 |
| Wall time | ~120 min |
| Stall | `STALL_MINUTES` (manager skill, default 30) |

A dispatch spans three billed phases (implement → test loop → report; the
handoff between them is a context boundary, not a billed phase), so every
dimension with a per-phase counterpart must sit strictly above the
worst-case compliant dispatch — per-phase cap × 3. Per dimension: billed
input ~5M is ~11× the worst case (~450k); requests ~600 sit strictly above
the worst case (3 × ~150 = ~450) — the rule is that the request backstop
must exceed the per-phase request cap × the expected billed phase count,
never equal or undercut it; wall time has no per-phase counterpart, so no
such arithmetic applies and ~120 min is a free-plan-safe ceiling for a
typical dispatch, not a margin over a per-phase budget. A subagent honoring
the escape hatch hands off long before a breach, so a breach is evidence
the subagent is ignoring the hatch (or that a respawn is re-burning). Detection is from telemetry evidence — the ZCode
telemetry DB `~/.zcode/cli/db/db.sqlite` (`model_usage` / `tool_usage`),
the AgenQ dashboard (`http://localhost:8787/api/state`), or the agent
record's `metadata.json` usage block (`docs/AGENT-USAGE-METADATA.md`;
capture-time-only — post-hoc, never a live mid-run signal) —
never from subagent prose. On a breach the manager dispatches the
assistant-manager (role C, read-only) to analyze why, then nudges the
subagent via the continue mechanism, respawns it from its last checkpoint,
or escalates to the owner. Watchdog failure (DB or dashboard unavailable) is
observable and never blocks the main loop.

## Role registry

This directory is the role-file home the ZCode harness parses (see the
pinned-defaults table above). The *dispatch* mechanics for running the
manager loop live in the per-harness adapters under
`.agents/skills/manager/`: `.agents/skills/manager/ZCODE-ADAPTER.md`
(reference harness) and `.agents/skills/manager/DSH-ADAPTER.md`
(DeepSeek Harness — verified).

## Adapting to another harness

The workflow in `.agents/skills/manager/SKILL.md` relies on exactly these
capabilities, which any harness must supply to run it end-to-end:

1. A subagent/Task tool with named `subagent_type` + background dispatch.
2. Agent-definition files per role (this directory) with a per-role model
   field.
3. `gh` CLI access (subagents use `gh` for PR and comment operations).

To run on another harness, create the **same-named role agents** in that
harness's agent-definition directory, translating the frontmatter model key
to that harness's convention — or, when the harness parses no agent files,
give it an adapter that honors these pins through its own dispatch rule.

This repo's second harness **DSH (DeepSeek Harness)** works exactly that way:
its verified adapter — dispatch recipe for all six roles and the pin-routing
rule — lives in `.agents/skills/manager/DSH-ADAPTER.md` (ADR-0005).
